# Prerequisites
There are two methods to deploy your bot to the internet so that everyone can use it.

Before using any method, you need to ensure that:
1. You have a `requirements.py` file which includes all the additional requirements which you might have installed while creating your bot.
2. The name of the file in which the `on_message` function is present is named `main.py`.
3. Zip these two files, i.e., `requirements.txt` and `main.py` into a `.zip` archive. It's important that it's a **`.zip`** archive and not anything else.
